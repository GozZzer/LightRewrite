My light Configuration for my APA102 Light Strips.

I`ll overwrite the README but for now i just keep it as it is rigth now,\
because the is not really mucht to say about it.


## Editing

First you have to choose a strip you want to edit:
> b (Bed)\
> t (Table)\
> a (All)

Then you have the ability to edit more things:
> d (enable/disable)\
> r (rotate)\
> g (grade)\
> c (Color)
